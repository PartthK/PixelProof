# Welcome to PixelProof!

Welcome to **PixelProof**, the global standard for video authentication. Video & image AI-generation is about to change the content we consume forever, where the line between real and fake will become blurred - and we plan to rebuild this line.


## What We Do

We give videos and images a PP-score that represents the probability of it being fake (AI-generated). In a world that is soon approaching a AI-video revolution, it is vital that we build a secure and accurate method of verifying what might be real or fake.

## How We Do It
When a user inputs a video or image to our website, we process the video through our blockchain to compute its associated PP-key. We then calculate the PP-score, which we link to the PP-key using our blockchain. We then output the PP-score and PP-key to the user. 

Our future goal is to have a page on our website that takes the PP-key as input and outputs the associated video and its PP-score. This way, users know exactly what video is what, and if people try to alter any video that is registered in our blockchain, the altered version is no longer associated with a PP-key, and is also not part of our blockchain. Any miniscule alteration of a video or image will result in a different PP-key.
